# Gothic Fiction Pattern Detection

A masters thesis about pattern detection in gothic fiction with the use of distant reading, topic modeling and network analysis.

Due to the fact that the excellent interactive visualizations of pyLDAvis and Dash are less than ideal for print publication, but are also not rendered online in the ipynb file, additional graphs to cover the same content statically were added, specifically the topic_wordclouds.png. For an easier viewing experience html versions of the notebooks are provided, given that some visualizations in the 3rd section are interactive, the html file provides a better experience rendering all the elements correctly.

Python 3.9 is required for this project. The modeling notebook introduces a few dependencies that are incommensurable with those used in the other notebooks, it is advisable to work with seperate virtual environments, which is why two updated requirements files are provided.
