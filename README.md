# Gothic Fiction Pattern Detection

A masters thesis about pattern detection in gothic fiction with the use of distant reading, topic modeling and network analysis.

Due to the fact that the excellent interactive visualizations of pyLDAvis are less than ideal for print publication a lot of additional graphs to cover the same content statically were added that increased the size of the 3rd notebook beyond the scope of what Github is willing to display in the browser.

Python 3.9 is required for this project. The modeling notebook introduces a few dependencies that are incommensurable with those used in the other notebooks, in case you wish to rerun parts of those sections, it is advisable to work with seperate virtual environments.
